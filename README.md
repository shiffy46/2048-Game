# 2048-Game
This was a project for my Computer Science 227 Course here at ISU, We coded it in Java in eclipse

Our assignment was to create the model for the game and we were given the api and controller for it.
My contribution is in the hw3 folder and there are two files, GameUtil and Game.
These files are classes used in the game that implement the logic behind the merging and movement of tiles within it.
